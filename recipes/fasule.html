    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite childhood meals, Fasule is a great meal to have during the cold months that will keep you full and happy
        Here's how to make it:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Salt - 2-3 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Pack/Bag of white beans</li>
        <li>1 Whole White Onion</li>
        <li>1-2 Celery Stalk(s) (You can also use a green pepper)</li>
        <li>1-2 Carrot(s)</li>
        <li>1-2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Can of crushed tomatoes OR Two Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Source of water</li>
        <li>Instant/Pressure Pot</li>
        <li>Colander</li>
        <li>Knife</li>
        <li>Ladle</li>
        <li>Bowl for Beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Preparation:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill bowl with beans</li>
        <li>Pour water into the bean-filled bowl</li>
        <li>Let beans sit in bowl overnight</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking:</h4>
    <p><strong>NOTE: IF YOU HAVE CANNED CRUSHED TOMATOES, IGNORE STEPS OR PARTS OF STEPS INVOLVING BOILING/PREPPING THE TOMATOES.</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour beans and some water into the pot. It should be enough water so that you can cover the beans and allow room for tomatoes to be put in.</li>
        <li>Place pot over medium-heat.</li>
        <li>Score the top of the tomato with a knife, two cuts in the shape of a cross.</li>
        <li>Once water comes to a boil, place tomatoes inside for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the tomatoes with ladle and pour contents of the pot into the colander to drain. Let beans cool in the meantime.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have access to a kettle, pour water in there (Again, enough to cover beans and allow for some room) and begin heating it. 
        This will speed up the cooking process later. Otherwise, just fill your bowl with water and let it sit on the side.</li>
        <li>Chop the carrots, dice the onion, mince garlic, peel and dice tomatoes, and chop/dice celery/peppers.</li>
        <li>Heat pot over medium/medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour olive oil into pot once heated and place vegetables in.</li>
        <li>Allow vegatables to sautee for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in beans and water from kettle OR bowl, reduce heat to medium-low or low (Depending on your stovetop and how much fire is produced).</li>
        <li>Cover pressure pot with lid and wait until steam begins to shoot from the top.</li>
        <li>Once steam begins to appear, set a timer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, turn off heat, and let the pot sit for 10+ minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully, open the lid, and serve your fasule in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
