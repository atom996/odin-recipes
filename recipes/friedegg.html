    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried eggs are a good way to start your day. Eggs are not only nutritious, but they are <em>tasty</em> as well!
    My favorite way to fry eggs is over-easy. Some people prefer sunny-side up, but this is
    just how I prefer it. Crispy all around, runny, and delicious. Here's how to make a simple, over-easy, fried-egg:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil (Or other fat of choice) - 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Salt - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Brown or White Egg (Medium/Large should do)</li>
        <li>Pan</li>
        <li>Spatula</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pan over fire (or electric stove top) at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Wait 1-2 minutes until pan is heated.</li>
        <li>Place fat of choice into pan and ensure that it is evenly spread over the pan.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg (or eggs if you're cooking more than one) into the pan.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the salt over the egg(s). <em>Note:</em> If you do not have a way to measure 1/2 of a teaspoon, a pinch of salt should do.</li>
        <li>Fry for 30 seconds - 1 minute, or until whites are mostly cooked.</li>
        <li>Flip egg and fry for another 30 seconds - 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Optionally: Season with another pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
