    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ah, chicken breast, a staple in every gym-bro's diet. Not only is it filled with protein,
        it is also very versatile as a meal. You can fry it, bake it, etc. This is my take on Chicken Breast:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil (Or other fat of choice) - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Whole chicken breast</li>
        <li>Black pepper - 1-2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>1/2 Lemon</li>
        <li>Optional: Seasonings of choice</li>
        <li>Pan (And if you have one, a lid)</li>
        <li>Tongs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt, black pepper, and the other (optional) seasonings if you have them.</li>
        <li>Place pan over fire (or electric stove top) at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Wait 1-2 minutes until pan is heated.</li>
        <li>Pour fat of choice into pan.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breast into pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for 4 minutes (Keep it covered if you have a lid).</li>
        <li>Flip after 4 minutes (Cover again if you have a lid) and cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Plate chicken and squeeze some lemon over said chicken.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
